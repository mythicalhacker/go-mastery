# API Design (Go Libraries & Services)

API design is the discipline of choosing your **exported surface** so it stays small, stays compatible, and reads well at the call site. The Go 1 backward-compatibility promise is the model to copy for your own packages: once published, **you cannot break callers**. Every exported name is a liability you maintain forever — design for the *zero value*, accept interfaces sparingly, return concrete types, and add (never change) when you evolve.

> Verified against Go **1.26.4** (stable) + **1.27 RC** notes, 2026-06. Version tags `[1.N]` mark the release a claim applies to. No research corpus — claims are checked against go.dev primary sources; `[verify]` marks anything I could not confirm.

## TL;DR — the judgment calls (read first)

- **The Go 1 promise is your contract too.** Adding an exported field/method is *usually* safe; removing/renaming/retyping one is *always* breaking. Unkeyed struct literals break on field addition — which is why the stdlib uses *keyed* literals and why config structs are safe to grow.
- **`context.Context` is the first parameter, named `ctx`, never a struct field** — storing it outlives the request and defeats cancellation (narrow exception: short-lived request structs).
- **"Accept interfaces, return concrete types" is a default, not a law.** Define the interface *in the consumer*, keep it tiny. Returning an interface from a constructor is the classic over-abstraction that makes the type un-extendable.
- **Design so the zero value is useful.** `sync.Mutex`, `bytes.Buffer`, `time.Time` all work at `var x T`; prefer that to forcing a `New`.
- **Functional options vs config struct is a real fork.** Options = open-ended/optional/future-proof (*libraries*); struct = simpler/greppable (*internal*). Don't cargo-cult options onto a two-field constructor.
- **`%w` exposes an error as part of your API; document what callers may match** — a sentinel/typed error a caller can `errors.Is`/`AsType` is a commitment ([errors-and-resilience.md](errors-and-resilience.md#wrapping-strategy)).
- **Iterator-returning APIs use `iter.Seq`/`Seq2` [1.23]** — name the method `All`, document single-use iterators explicitly.
- **`/v2` in the module path is how Go does a major version** — SemVer major ≥ 2 *must* change the import path; there is no in-place breaking release.

## The Go 1 compatibility discipline for your libraries {#compat-discipline}

Go's own promise — "programs written to the Go 1 spec continue to compile and run, unchanged" — is the standard to hold your packages to. Two stdlib mechanics show *how* the team keeps it, and both are tools you should adopt:

- **Keyed struct literals survive field additions.** The Go 1 doc is explicit: adding a field to an exported struct breaks code that used an *unkeyed* literal (`pkg.T{3, "x"}`) but not a *keyed* one (`pkg.T{A: 3}`). Therefore: in your own code use keyed literals for any struct from another package, and design config structs knowing callers must key them.
- **GODEBUG + the `go` line gate behavioral changes [1.21].** When the stdlib must change a runtime default, it keys the old-vs-new behavior off the `go` line in `go.mod`. You get the same lever for free — but the lesson for *your* API is: a behavior change is a breaking change even when the *signature* is identical.

```go
// WRONG — unkeyed literal of a foreign struct: breaks the moment the author adds a field.
cfg := pkg.Config{8080, "0.0.0.0", true}

// RIGHT — keyed; immune to additive growth, and self-documenting.
cfg := pkg.Config{Port: 8080, Host: "0.0.0.0", TLS: true}
```

**What this buys the API designer:** a struct of options grows safely *forever* as long as new fields are optional with a sensible zero value, because every well-behaved caller keys their literal. That single fact underwrites the whole "config struct" pattern below.

---

## Designing for the useful zero value {#zero-value}

The best Go APIs make `var x T` immediately usable — no constructor, no init flag, no nil-pointer trap. `sync.Mutex`, `bytes.Buffer`, `strings.Builder`, `time.Time`, and `sync.WaitGroup` all work at their zero value. This is an *ergonomic* win: it removes a `New`, removes an error return, and makes embedding trivial.

```go
// RIGHT — zero value is ready; no constructor needed.
type Counter struct {
    mu sync.Mutex      // zero-usable
    n  map[string]int  // lazily made on first write keeps the zero value valid
}

func (c *Counter) Inc(key string) {
    c.mu.Lock()
    defer c.mu.Unlock()
    if c.n == nil {
        c.n = make(map[string]int)
    }
    c.n[key]++
}
```

**When a constructor *is* warranted:** invariants the zero value can't express (an open DB handle, a validated address, a `>0` capacity). Then return a concrete type and document that the zero value is invalid. Don't expose a half-built struct whose validity depends on a flag the caller must remember to set.

---

## Accept interfaces, return concrete types — and its limits {#accept-return}

The proverb encodes two separate decisions. **Accept interfaces** so callers can pass any implementation and so tests can fake dependencies. **Return concrete types** so you can add methods/fields later without breaking anyone, and so callers see the real capabilities (godoc, autocompletion) instead of a lowest-common-denominator interface.

```go
// RIGHT — accept the narrowest interface you actually use; return the concrete result.
func Copy(dst io.Writer, src io.Reader) (int64, error)   // not *os.File, not *bytes.Buffer
func Open(name string) (*os.File, error)                 // concrete: callers get *all* of *os.File
```

**Define the interface where it's consumed, not where it's implemented.** Go interfaces are structural, so the consumer declares the one or two methods it needs and any producer satisfies it without an import. A `Store` interface with one method belongs in the package that *calls* it — not a 12-method "repository interface" shipped beside the implementation.

```go
package billing // consumer-side, minimal — the DB package never imports this.
type accountStore interface{ Account(ctx context.Context, id string) (Account, error) }
func Charge(ctx context.Context, s accountStore, id string, cents int64) error { /* ... */ }
```

**The limits (where the proverb misleads):**
- **Don't return an interface from a constructor.** `func New() Doer` locks the concrete type away; you can never add a method callers can reach, and you've forced an allocation behind an interface for no reason. Return `*Client`; let callers narrow to an interface *they* define.
- **Exception: a small, stable, deliberately-polymorphic contract** (`error`, `io.Reader`, `http.Handler`, `driver.Conn`) is *meant* to be returned as an interface. The test is whether the interface is the product (a plugin point) or an accident of "I might want to mock this."
- **Don't accept an interface you don't call through.** Taking `io.ReadWriteCloser` when you only `Read` over-constrains every caller; take `io.Reader`.

---

## context.Context as the first parameter {#context-param}

`context.Context` is **always the first parameter, named `ctx`**, on any function that does I/O, blocks, or spans an RPC. It carries cancellation, deadlines, and request-scoped values down the call tree.

```go
func (s *Service) Fetch(ctx context.Context, id string) (*Record, error)   // RIGHT
```

**Never store a `Context` in a struct.** A context models a single operation's lifetime; a struct outlives the operation. Stashing it means later calls share a stale, possibly-cancelled context (or worse, one whose deadline already fired). The stdlib `context` docs say this outright. The one tolerated exception is a short-lived *request* struct that exists only for that request — and even then, prefer threading `ctx` as a parameter.

```go
// WRONG — context captured in the struct; every method silently uses a frozen lifetime.
type Client struct{ ctx context.Context }
func (c *Client) Do() error { return call(c.ctx) }

// RIGHT — context flows per call.
type Client struct{ http *http.Client }
func (c *Client) Do(ctx context.Context) error { return call(ctx, c.http) }
```

**Design rules:** make `ctx` non-optional (no `nil` — pass `context.Background()`); never use a context value to pass *required* arguments (values are for request-scoped extras like a trace ID, behind an unexported key type); a library that needs cancellation should *take* `ctx`, not invent its own `Cancel()` method. Full cancellation/deadline mechanics: [errors-and-resilience.md](errors-and-resilience.md#timeouts).

---

## Error contracts: what callers may match {#error-contracts}

Your errors are part of your API the moment a caller branches on them. The design question is **what you let callers match, and what you promise to keep matchable.** Three contracts (Cheney's taxonomy):

| Contract | Caller matches with | You promise | Use when |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sentinel** `var ErrX = errors.New(...)` | `errors.Is(err, pkg.ErrX)` | this value stays returned for this condition | a tiny, stable set of conditions (`io.EOF`, `sql.ErrNoRows`) |
| **Typed** `type XError struct{...}` | `errors.AsType[*pkg.XError](err)` [1.26] | the type + its exported fields stay stable | callers need structured data (which field, retry-after, code) |
| **Opaque** (return; expose a *behavior*) | `errors.AsType[interface{ Timeout() bool }](err)` | nothing about the concrete type | default at boundaries — add context without committing to a type |

```go
// Get returns the user. It returns [ErrNotFound] if no user has the given id.
func (s *Store) Get(ctx context.Context, id string) (User, error) { ... } // the doc comment IS the contract
```

**Judgment:**
- **`%w` is a commitment.** `fmt.Errorf("get %s: %w", id, sql.ErrNoRows)` promises callers `errors.Is(err, sql.ErrNoRows)` keeps working — even across a driver swap. Wrap to *expose*; use `%v` (or a domain sentinel) to *hide* internals at a boundary. Mechanics: [errors-and-resilience.md](errors-and-resilience.md#wrapping-strategy).
- **Document exactly which sentinels/types are matchable** — anything undocumented is implementation detail callers must not depend on, leaving you free to change it.
- **Sentinels create import coupling** (callers import your package); a *behavior interface* is satisfied structurally with no import — often the more evolvable cross-package contract. Never make callers match `err.Error()` substrings.

---

## Functional options vs config structs {#options-vs-config}

Both configure a constructor; they trade simplicity against extensibility. Pick deliberately — the choice is itself an API decision because it's hard to reverse.

**Functional options** — open-ended, every option optional, additive forever, great for a *public library* with many knobs:

```go
type Server struct {
    addr    string
    timeout time.Duration
    logger  *slog.Logger
}

type Option func(*Server)

func WithTimeout(d time.Duration) Option { return func(s *Server) { s.timeout = d } }
func WithLogger(l *slog.Logger) Option   { return func(s *Server) { s.logger = l } }

func NewServer(addr string, opts ...Option) *Server {
    s := &Server{addr: addr, timeout: 30 * time.Second, logger: slog.Default()} // defaults
    for _, opt := range opts {
        opt(s)
    }
    return s
}
// Call site reads as intent; adding WithTLS later breaks nobody.
srv := NewServer(":8080", WithTimeout(5*time.Second))
```

**Config struct** — simpler, greppable, zero indirection; ideal for *internal* code or when most fields are set together. Safe to grow *because callers use keyed literals* (see [compat discipline](#compat-discipline)):

```go
type Config struct {
    Addr    string
    Timeout time.Duration // zero → caller didn't set it; apply default in New
    Logger  *slog.Logger
}

func New(cfg Config) *Server {
    if cfg.Timeout == 0 {
        cfg.Timeout = 30 * time.Second
    }
    return &Server{ /* ... */ }
}
```

**Decision:** public library with many optional knobs that will grow → **options**; internal package, fields set together, you value grep-ability → **config struct**. Don't put options on a constructor with no optional params (ceremony); don't use a config struct when ordered required+optional validation calls for options. A hybrid (required positional, optional via `...Option`) is fine — but never an `Options` struct *plus* `...Option`; pick one source of truth.

---

## Minimal exported surface {#minimal-surface}

Every exported identifier is a forever-commitment. The smaller the surface, the more you can change internally without a major version. Concrete moves:

- **Unexport by default; export on demand.** It's trivial to export later (additive, non-breaking); un-exporting is breaking. Start lowercase.
- **Put non-API helpers in `internal/`.** Code under `internal/` is importable only within your module, so it's never part of your contract — use it freely for shared implementation. (Package design: [project-patterns.md](project-patterns.md#package-design).)
- **Don't export a type just to return it** if callers only need the interface they define — but *do* return concrete types you expect callers to use directly (see [accept/return](#accept-return)).
- **Hide fields behind methods only when there's an invariant.** A plain data struct with exported fields is more idiomatic than reflexive getters/setters; Go has no `Get`/`Set` convention. Add accessors when you must validate or compute.
- **One obvious way in.** Multiple constructors that differ subtly (`New`, `NewWithX`, `NewWithXY`) signal you want options. Collapse them.

```go
// WRONG — Java-style accessors with no invariant to protect.
type Point struct{ x, y int }
func (p Point) GetX() int { return p.x }
func (p *Point) SetX(x int) { p.x = x }

// RIGHT — exported fields; the zero value is a valid origin.
type Point struct{ X, Y int }
```

---

## Evolving without breaking: fields, methods, Deprecated {#backward-compat}

The Go 1 doc enumerates exactly what stays compatible. Apply it to your packages:

**Safe (additive):**
- Add an exported function, method, type, const, or variable.
- Add a field to an exported struct — *callers using keyed literals are unaffected* (unkeyed break; that's their bug per the doc).
- Add a method to a concrete (non-interface) type — *unless* the type is meant to be embedded, where the new method can collide with another embedded type's method (the doc flags this rare case explicitly).
- Widen what you accept (e.g., relax a validation) — usually safe; tightening is not.

**Breaking (needs `/v2`):**
- Remove/rename any exported identifier; change a function signature or a field's type.
- **Add a method to an *interface* you export** — every external implementer instantly fails to satisfy it. This is why public interfaces should be *small and frozen*.
- Change documented behavior or a documented error contract.

**Deprecation — the `// Deprecated:` convention:** keep the symbol working, mark it so tooling (gopls, staticcheck `SA1019`) warns. The paragraph must start exactly with `Deprecated:`.

```go
// ParseLegacy parses the v1 wire format.
//
// Deprecated: use [Parse], which handles both formats. ParseLegacy will be
// removed in the next major version.
func ParseLegacy(b []byte) (*Msg, error) { ... }
```

**`//go:fix inline` [1.26]** lets you ship a *mechanical migration*: annotate a deprecated function whose body is a thin wrapper, and `go fix` rewrites call sites for downstream users automatically — the cleanest deprecation path when the replacement is a drop-in.

```go
//go:fix inline
func Sum(a, b int) int { return Add(a, b) } // go fix rewrites Sum(x,y) → Add(x,y)
```

---

## SemVer and /v2 module paths {#versioning}

Go modules tie SemVer to the import path. For **v0/v1**, the module path is plain (`example.com/foo`). For **major version ≥ 2**, the major number is part of the path: `example.com/foo/v2`. There is no in-place breaking release — a breaking change *is* a new import path, so v1 and v2 can coexist in one build.

```go
// go.mod for a v2 module
module example.com/foo/v2

go 1.25
```
```go
import "example.com/foo/v2" // callers opt in explicitly; v1 imports keep working untouched
```

**Rules that bite:** `v0.x` makes *no* compatibility promise (the one window to break freely); `v1` starts the Go 1-style promise. Tag releases `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`. A pre-release `v2.0.0` still needs the `/v2` path. `replace`/`retract` directives live in `go.mod` for pulling bad versions. **The `go` directive is a forward-compat floor [1.21]:** `go 1.25.0` means the module *cannot* build on 1.24 — set it to your true minimum, not reflexively to the latest. (Toolchain/build detail: [platform-and-build.md](platform-and-build.md).)

---

## Iterator-returning APIs (iter.Seq) {#iterators}

Since [1.23], a function/method that yields a sequence returns an `iter.Seq[V]` or `iter.Seq2[K, V]` — a push iterator consumable by `range`. This is the idiomatic shape for "give me each X" APIs, replacing ad-hoc callback or channel designs.

```go
type Seq[V any]      func(yield func(V) bool)
type Seq2[K, V any]  func(yield func(K, V) bool)
```

**Conventions from the `iter` package docs (follow them — they're how callers expect your API to read):**
- Name the all-elements method **`All`**; name an alternate order **`Backward`**, **`Preorder`**, etc.; a filtered/configured one takes args (`Scan(min, max K) iter.Seq2[K,V]`).
- **Document single-use iterators explicitly** — if the sequence can't be replayed (a network/stream source), the doc comment must say "It returns a single-use iterator." Default iterators are restartable.
- Functions that *accept or return* sequences should use the standard `iter.Seq`/`Seq2` types so they compose with `range`, `slices.Sorted`, `maps.Keys`, etc.

```go
// All returns an iterator over the set's elements in unspecified order.
func (s *Set[V]) All() iter.Seq[V] {
    return func(yield func(V) bool) {
        for v := range s.m {
            if !yield(v) { // honor early break — caller may stop mid-range
                return
            }
        }
    }
}

for v := range set.All() { use(v) }
```

**Judgment:** return a `Seq` when laziness/early-exit/large-or-infinite data matters; return a plain `[]T` when the set is small and callers want to index, re-iterate, or store it — don't make every accessor an iterator. For pull-style consumption, `iter.Pull` converts a `Seq` to a `next`/`stop` pair (caller must `defer stop()`). More: [advanced-patterns.md](advanced-patterns.md#iterators).

---

## Generic API ergonomics & inference {#generics}

Generics [1.18] earn their place when an API is genuinely type-parametric (containers, `slices`/`maps`-style helpers, a typed result wrapper). The ergonomic test is **inference**: a good generic signature lets callers omit type arguments.

```go
// RIGHT — type inferred from the argument; reads like a normal call.
func Map[T, U any](s []T, f func(T) U) []U
nums := Map(words, func(w string) int { return len(w) }) // no [string,int] needed

// Constraint via an interface in `constraints`-style form or the built-in `comparable`.
func Index[T comparable](s []T, v T) int
```

**Design rules:**
- **Don't add a type parameter you can't infer** — if callers must always write `F[SomeType](...)`, the generic is friction; consider an interface or a concrete API instead.
- **Constrain to the smallest set of methods/operations** the body uses; over-broad constraints (`any` when you need ordering) push failures to odd places.
- **Return type parameters are inferred from arguments, not results** — `func New[T any]() *Box[T]` forces `New[int]()`. Prefer taking a value (`New(0)`) or accept the explicit instantiation only when it reads clearly.
- **A method cannot add its own type parameter** before [1.27] — parametric behavior lives on the *type*. **[1.27 RC] adds generic methods**, which will enable type-parametric assertion/visitor methods; treat as draft until GA (~Aug 2026). [verify exact 1.27 generic-method scope at GA]
- Generics don't replace interfaces. Use an interface for *runtime* polymorphism (heterogeneous values, plugins); use generics to *avoid `any` + assertions* in homogeneous code. (Patterns: [design-patterns.md](design-patterns.md#go-specific).)

---

## Variadics and option-like signatures {#variadics}

Variadics (`args ...T`) fit "zero or more of the same thing" (`fmt.Println`, `append`, functional options). They become a smell when faking optional/heterogeneous params:

```go
func Connect(addr string, timeout ...time.Duration) // WRONG — is two timeouts an error? silently ignored?
func Connect(addr string, opts ...Option)           // RIGHT — optionality made explicit
```

**Contract gotchas:** `f(s...)` shares `s`'s backing array, so a variadic that retains or mutates `args` can surprise callers — document it. An empty call yields a `nil` slice inside; handle it. Don't append to `args` and return it as if fresh.

---

## Godoc-driven design & examples as tests {#godoc}

In Go, the doc *is* `godoc` rendered from your comments, so designing the API and documenting it are the same act. If a doc comment is hard to write, the API is probably wrong.

- **Every exported symbol gets a doc comment starting with its name** (`// Parse parses ...`). The package gets a `// Package foo ...` comment. Reference other symbols with `[Name]` for links [1.19 doc-comment links].
- **Document the contract, not the implementation:** preconditions, what's returned on each error, goroutine-safety, whether a returned slice/map is owned by the caller or must not be mutated, and which errors are matchable (see [error contracts](#error-contracts)).
- **Examples are tests.** A function `ExampleParse` in `_test.go` with an `// Output:` comment is *compiled and run* by `go test` and rendered in godoc. This keeps examples correct forever and is the best pressure-test of call-site ergonomics — if the example is awkward, redesign.

```go
func ExampleParse() {
    msg, _ := foo.Parse([]byte("hello"))
    fmt.Println(msg.Kind)
    // Output: greeting
}
```

`Example`, `ExampleT`, `ExampleT_method`, and `Example_suffix` map to specific symbols in the rendered docs. An example *without* an `// Output:` comment still compiles (catches API breakage) but isn't run. Testing detail: [testing.md](testing.md).

---

## REST surface conventions {#rest-naming}

For HTTP services the public surface is the URL/verb/payload shape — the same compatibility rules apply (additive is safe; removing a field or changing a status is breaking). Follow the [Google API Design Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design): plural-noun collections (`/users`), kebab-case multi-word paths, at most one nesting level (`/users/{id}/posts`; deeper → promote to top-level with query filters), non-CRUD actions as a sub-path verb (`POST /orders/{id}/cancel`). Use real status codes (never `200` + an error body) and [RFC 9457](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9457.html) `application/problem+json` for errors. Version only on breaking changes; signal lifecycle with `Deprecation` [RFC 9745] and `Sunset` [RFC 8594] headers. The compatibility judgment is identical to libraries: **adding a field/endpoint is safe, removing/retyping needs a new `/v2`** — and the service analogue of "don't add a method to a published interface" is "don't change a documented response shape." Handler/pagination/validation/codegen mechanics: [http-and-apis.md](http-and-apis.md).

---

## Error-response design (problem+json) {#error-responses}

Your error *body* is API surface — clients branch on it, so it carries the same compatibility weight as a success shape. Use **[RFC 9457](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9457.html) `application/problem+json`** as the envelope and a **stable, machine-readable `code`** as the field clients actually switch on. The HTTP status is the coarse class; `code` is the contract.

```go
// RIGHT — problem+json: status is the class, `code` is the stable branch key.
type Problem struct {
    Type     string `json:"type"`              // URI identifying the problem class (or "about:blank")
    Title    string `json:"title"`             // short, human, stable per type
    Status   int    `json:"status"`            // mirrors the HTTP status
    Detail   string `json:"detail,omitempty"`  // this occurrence; safe to vary
    Instance string `json:"instance,omitempty"`// URI/ID for this occurrence (e.g. trace ID)
    Code     string `json:"code"`              // YOUR stable enum: "user_not_found" — never renumber
}
```

**Judgment:**
- **`code` is a frozen enum, like a sentinel error.** Clients write `switch p.Code`; renaming `user_not_found` is a breaking change. The localizable `title`/`detail` are free to change; the `code` is not.
- **Never leak internals.** No stack traces, SQL, driver text, or wrapped `err.Error()` in `detail` — that leaks schema and aids attackers. Map internal errors to a code at the boundary and `slog` the real error *once* server-side with the `instance`/trace ID (see [errors-and-resilience.md](errors-and-resilience.md#wrapping-strategy)). The internal sentinel/typed error ([error contracts](#error-contracts)) is what you switch on to *choose* the code — it never reaches the wire verbatim.
- **One envelope for the whole service.** Don't return bare strings on some routes and problem+json on others; a client should parse failures one way.

Set `Content-Type: application/problem+json`. Status-code selection mechanics (422 vs 400, 409, 413): [http-and-apis.md](http-and-apis.md#validation).

---

## Request validation as contract {#validation}

Validation is part of the published contract: **what you reject, and the shape of the rejection, are promises**. Validate **at the boundary** (right after decode, before the service call) and return **actionable per-field errors** so a client can fix the request without guessing.

```go
// RIGHT — per-field, machine-readable; one code per failure mode.
type FieldError struct {
    Field   string `json:"field"`   // "email", "items[2].qty" — JSON path the client sent
    Code    string `json:"code"`    // "required", "too_long" — stable enum, not prose
    Message string `json:"message"` // human hint; may change freely
}
// Embed []FieldError in the problem+json body ([#error-responses]) under "errors".
```

**Judgment:**
- **Return all field errors, not first-fail** — `errors.Join` [1.20] collects them so the client fixes the form in one round trip.
- **`field` mirrors the client's payload path** (the JSON pointer they sent), not your Go struct field name — that's what lets a UI attach the error to the right input.
- **Loosening validation is safe; tightening is breaking.** Adding a new required field or a stricter rule rejects previously-valid requests — treat it like a signature change ([backward-compat](#backward-compat)).
- Keep **cross-field and business rules in code** (a `Validate()` method); push only mechanical per-field constraints to tags. For `go-playground/validator` tag mechanics and the 400-vs-422 split, see [http-and-apis.md](http-and-apis.md#validation).

---

## Pagination: cursor vs offset {#pagination}

Pick the pagination model deliberately — it's hard to change once clients depend on it. The fork is **cursor (opaque token)** vs **offset/limit**.

| | Cursor (opaque token) | Offset / limit |
|---|---|---|
| **Use when** | large/changing datasets, infinite scroll, public APIs | small/stable data, jump-to-page UIs, admin tools |
| **Correctness under writes** | stable — no skipped/duplicated rows as data shifts | drifts — inserts/deletes shift the window |
| **Cost at depth** | constant (seek `WHERE id > ?`) | grows — `OFFSET n` scans+discards n rows |
| **Can jump to page N** | no | yes |

```go
// RIGHT — opaque cursor: base64 of the sort key(s); clients MUST treat it as a blob.
type Page[T any] struct {
    Items      []T    `json:"items"`
    NextCursor string `json:"next_cursor,omitempty"` // empty = last page
}
// Decode → seek; never expose raw offsets/IDs inside the token.
```

**Judgment:**
- **Order by a stable, unique key** (e.g. `(created_at, id)`); a non-unique sort column makes cursors skip or repeat rows at boundaries.
- **The cursor is opaque** — encode the keyset and *only* document "pass `next_cursor` back." That lets you change the pagination internals later without breaking clients (offsets-in-URLs become permanent contract).
- **Enforce a server-side page-size cap.** Treat `limit` as a request, clamp to a max (e.g. ≤100), apply a default when absent — never let a client ask for everything. SQL/handler wiring: [http-and-apis.md](http-and-apis.md).

## Rate-limit response design {#rate-limiting}

This is about the *protocol you expose* when throttling, not the limiter algorithm. On a throttle, return **`429 Too Many Requests`** and tell the client when to come back; on the path to the limit, advertise the quota so well-behaved clients self-pace.

```go
func writeRateLimited(w http.ResponseWriter, retryAfter time.Duration) {
    w.Header().Set("Retry-After", strconv.Itoa(int(retryAfter.Seconds()))) // RFC 9110 — seconds or HTTP-date
    // Draft RateLimit fields (see note): advertise remaining quota + the policy.
    w.Header().Set("RateLimit", `limit=100, remaining=0, reset=30`)
    w.Header().Set("RateLimit-Policy", `100;w=60`) // 100 requests per 60s window
    writeProblem(w, http.StatusTooManyRequests, "rate_limited")
}
```

**Judgment:**
- **`Retry-After` is the one you must send on 429** — it's standardized (RFC 9110) and clients/SDKs honor it for backoff.
- **`RateLimit` / `RateLimit-Policy` are an IETF *draft*, not an RFC** (`draft-ietf-httpapi-ratelimit-headers`, rev 10, currently expired/not-yet-approved as of 2026-06) `[verify]` — field syntax may still change. Send them as a courtesy so clients can self-throttle, but treat `Retry-After` + the 429 status as the load-bearing contract. (Older deployments used `X-RateLimit-*`; the unprefixed draft names are the current direction.)
- **Scope the policy per key/quota** (per API key, user, or tenant — not raw IP for authed APIs) and document the unit, window, and what counts. The limiter *algorithm* (token bucket via `golang.org/x/time/rate`, distributed counters) lives in [errors-and-resilience.md](errors-and-resilience.md#retry) / [http-and-apis.md](http-and-apis.md); this section is only the response shape.

## Bulk-operation API patterns {#bulk-operations}

A bulk endpoint (`POST /things:batchCreate`) trades round-trips for a harder contract: **one HTTP request, many independent outcomes**. The defining decision is **partial success** — report per-item status instead of failing the whole batch on one bad row.

```go
// RIGHT — per-item result; HTTP 200 even when some items failed.
type BulkResult[T any] struct {
    Results []ItemResult[T] `json:"results"` // same order/length as the request
}
type ItemResult[T any] struct {
    Index  int      `json:"index"`            // position in the submitted batch
    Status int      `json:"status"`           // per-item: 201 created, 409 conflict, 422 invalid
    Item   *T       `json:"item,omitempty"`   // present on success
    Error  *Problem `json:"error,omitempty"`  // problem+json per failed item ([#error-responses])
}
```

**Judgment:**
- **Partial success is the default** — a single invalid item shouldn't 4xx the whole call (return 200/207 with per-item status). Choose all-or-nothing *only* when the batch is a true atomic transaction, and document which it is.
- **Idempotency keys make bulk retries safe.** Accept a client-supplied `Idempotency-Key` (header, or per item) and dedupe, so a retried batch after a network blip doesn't double-create. Persist the key→result mapping.
- **Cap request size** — both item count and total bytes (`http.MaxBytesReader`, see [http-and-apis.md](http-and-apis.md#server-hardening)). Unbounded bulk is a memory/DoS vector; reject oversized batches with 413 and a documented max.

## OpenAPI: spec-first vs code-first & codegen {#openapi-codegen}

The real decision is **direction**, and you must pick one as the single source of truth:

- **Spec-first** — the OpenAPI doc is authoritative; you *generate* Go server interfaces/types from it. Best when the contract is negotiated across teams/clients or you publish SDKs. Tool: **`oapi-codegen`** — current module path **`github.com/oapi-codegen/oapi-codegen/v2`** (verified on pkg.go.dev; the older `deepmap/oapi-codegen` path is its predecessor) — emits `net/http`/chi/echo server stubs plus typed models.
- **Code-first** — Go handlers are authoritative; you *generate* the spec from annotations (`swaggo/swag`) or hand-maintain it. Simpler for a single team but the spec can silently drift.

```go
// Spec-first: pin the generator via the go.mod `tool` directive [1.24], not a tools.go shim.
//go:generate go tool oapi-codegen -config cfg.yaml openapi.yaml
// Implement the generated ServerInterface; the compiler now enforces the contract.
```

**Judgment:**
- **Either direction is fine; drift is the failure.** Whichever you pick, **enforce sync in CI** — regenerate and `git diff --exit-code` (spec-first), or lint code against the spec / run contract tests (code-first). A spec that doesn't match the running server is worse than no spec.
- **Generate types, own the logic.** Let codegen produce request/response structs and the routing interface; keep validation and business rules in your code (see [#validation]).
- **Pin the generator version** in `go.mod` (`go tool`, [1.24]) so every dev and CI run emits identical code. ConnectRPC/gRPC users get the `.proto` as the contract instead — different toolchain, same "spec is the source of truth" discipline. Codegen mechanics and the `swaggo` vs `oapi-codegen` split: [http-and-apis.md](http-and-apis.md#api-versioning).

## What models get wrong {#stale}

1. Putting `context.Context` in a struct field instead of passing it first — defeats cancellation, freezes a lifetime.
2. Returning an **interface** from a constructor (`func New() Doer`) — you can never add a reachable method; return the concrete type.
3. Shipping a 12-method "repository interface" beside the implementation instead of small interfaces *in the consumer*.
4. Adding a method to a **published interface** and assuming it's additive — it breaks every external implementer.
5. Forgetting a breaking change requires a **`/v2` module path**; trying to ship a breaking release at the same path.
6. Cargo-culting functional options onto a no-optional constructor — and conversely, a config struct where ordered optional validation calls for options.
7. Needing a constructor for a type whose **zero value** could have been made useful (`var x T`).
8. Over-constraining a generic (`io.ReadWriteCloser` when you only `Read`; `any` when you need ordering) or a type parameter that **can't be inferred**.
9. Variadic-as-fake-optional (`timeout ...time.Duration`) instead of options/config.
10. Wrapping `%w` reflexively (leaks internals into your error contract) or masking an error callers needed — and not documenting which errors are matchable; branching on `err.Error()` substrings.
11. Naming a sequence accessor anything but `All`/`Backward`/… or not documenting a **single-use iterator** [1.23].
12. Unkeyed struct literals for foreign types — break on additive field growth; use keyed literals.
13. Reflexive Java-style getters/setters with no invariant; missing or implementation-focused doc comments; skipping **examples as tests**.
14. `// DEPRECATED`/`// deprecated` instead of the exact `// Deprecated:` paragraph form tooling recognizes.
